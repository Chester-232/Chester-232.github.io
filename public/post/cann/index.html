			<p>In a world where we&rsquo;re always talking-be it a text, video call, or face-to-face communication it&rsquo;s sometimes easy to forget how to actually connect with others. In class we may present, have an informal conversation with friends, or even send out the occasional DM online, good communication makes the difference. Sometimes it gets tough to maintain the right balance of speaking, listening, and understanding. Here are some simple tips and hacks that would make you a better communicator, in person and online.</p>
<h2 id="1-understand-the-setting">1. Understand the Setting</h2>
<p>Every situation has its very own &ldquo;vibe,&rdquo; and getting to know how to adjust your style can make all the difference. A casual hangout calls for a different tone than a formal presentation, and knowing when to switch helps you connect well with your audience.
Hack: Match your tone to the platform when online. Say, for instance, LinkedIn is a very professional &lsquo;post&rsquo; space, so make it formal; Instagram sorts out for a little relaxed, fun tone. Think of the context before saying or posting to set the right mood for your message.</p>
<h2 id="2-clarity-over-complication">2. Clarity Over Complication</h2>
<p>The best communication avoids confusion. Rather than using long explanations or convoluted words, be direct and clear. Simplicity can be a powerful rhetorical device if it means your ideas seem to come across, at least none of which leave people scratching their heads. Try to make things simple and easy to organize when talking online. Break down complicated ideas into short bullet points or add some visuals, which will help to reveal and explain your message better. Things get easier to understand that way; besides, your ideas become memorable and accessible as well.</p>
<h2 id="3-be-a-good-listener">3. Be a Good Listener</h2>
<p>Listening is a giant part of any conversation. In other words, it is not only the hearing of words, but rather can be seen as a show of one&rsquo;s ability to understand and respect the person speaking. Good listening makes people feel valued and brings stronger bonds. On video calls, nod or make soft vocal remarks to show interest without speaking louder. One is concentrating fully, distraction-free, and meaning that you care about their contribution and this encourages great communication.</p>
<h2 id="4-keep-an-eye-on-your-body-language">4. Keep an Eye on Your Body Language</h2>
<p>Body language can be more powerful than spoken words. There are such things as eye contact, facial expressions, and body posture that can say much about your mood and attitude. Even something as small as nodding may indicate interest and engagement, and hence people feel at ease talking to you. Don&rsquo;t downplay your online body language! Make sure your camera is at eye level while video conferencing, sit up straight and avoid fidgeting. These tiny details let people feel that you are attentive and interesting even when coming from a screen.</p>
<h2 id="5-be-the-balance-between-talking-and-listening">5. Be the Balance Between Talking and Listening</h2>
<p>A good conversation is like a tennis match it bounces both ways. It can unbalance if always talking or just listening. The hallmark of a great conversation is give and take in which the parties feel heard and valued. Pay attention to the flow of the conversation. If someone is opening up and sharing, be a good listener and ask thoughtful questions. If they are quieter, try sharing a little more about yourself and keeping the conversation flowing and pleasurable.</p>
<h2 id="6-leverage-online-tools-wisely">6. Leverage Online Tools Wisely</h2>
<p>In so many diverse platforms today, which one is best for each type of conversation does matter. It seems every person has a preferred method for texting, emailing, or video calling-whichever the case may be-and proper usage helps keep you from getting your meaning mixed up. Leverage the strength of each platform. Video calls are ideal for face-to-face discussions where one needs to see reactions; texts are handy for short updates that don&rsquo;t require elaborate communications; emails are better for detailed information that might need references at a later point in the conversation. Knowing when to use which tool makes all the difference on how your message will be received.</p>
<h2 id="7-mind-your-tone">7. Mind Your Tone</h2>
<p>The most challenging aspect that one is most likely to misinterpret while using a tone is online. One can sometimes sound abrupt or even insulting via facial expression and body language, when that&rsquo;s totally not the case. Paying attention to your tone can avoid them from getting the wrong idea and keeping the exercise friendly. Add some warmth in your words by using courteous expressions, or even emojis if appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="8-positive-and-open-minded">8. Positive and Open-Minded</h2>
<p>The best conversation occurs when both of you are comfortable and you respect each other; then, for one to be opened so will the other open up, and make great conversations. Allow others to share their thoughts no matter how they don&rsquo;t feel the same way as you do, this then gives them the safe place to discuss things honestly without the judgment.</p>
<p>Mastering the art of communication requires finding balance. The intersection of active listening, clarity in words and in body language connects you a little better-screen-based or even in the same physical space. So there you have it, practicing these tips and hacks really do make all the difference in making meaningful connections. Put down that screen every now and then and remember what communication is all about: connecting and understanding each other. To be better communicators and to further build more relationships in the virtual world and even in the actual one, we focus on these basics.</p>
